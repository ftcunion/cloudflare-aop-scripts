# Cloudflare Authenticated Origin Pulls Bash Scripts

This repository contains several minimal bash scripts which help you follow the instructions provided by Cloudflare to set up authenticated origin pulls:

- [Zone level instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/zone-level/): scripts are in the `zone` directory.
- [Hostname level instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/authenticated-origin-pull/set-up/per-hostname/): scripts are in the `hostname` directory.

To generate the certificates, you can use the `generate_certs.sh` script in the root directory. This script follows the instructions in the "Before you begin" section of the Cloudflare documentation.

In each directory, there are scripts to:

- `upload_cert.sh`: Upload the generated certificate and private key to Cloudflare. It assumes the paths from the `generate_certs.sh` script.
- `enable_cert.sh`: Enable the uploaded certificate for authenticated origin pulls.
- `list_cert.sh`: List the certificates uploaded for the zone or hostname.
- `status_cert.sh`: Check the status of a certificate.
- `delete_cert.sh`: Delete a certificate.

Of these, only the first two are required to set up authenticated origin pulls. The others are for managing the certificates and debugging. Each script just calls curl with the appropriate parameters.

## Dependencies

Every script except for `generate_certs.sh` requires `curl` (which is not preinstalled on Debian/Ubuntu). The `generate_certs.sh` script requires `openssl`.

## Usage

To use the scripts, you need to set up the `CONFIG` file with your Cloudflare account details:

```bash
MYAUTHEMAIL=""    # Email for Cloudflare account
MYAUTHKEY=""      # Global API Key for Cloudflare account, https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
ZONEID=""         # Zone ID for domain, available in overview tab of Cloudflare dashboard
HOSTNAME=""       # Hostname for hostname-level scripts
```

You can then run the scripts from the root of this repository. For example, generate, upload, and enable a zone-level certificate, you would run:

```bash
./generate_certs.sh
./zone/upload_cert.sh | jq
./zone/enable_cert.sh | jq
```

Piping to `jq` is optional. It just makes the json output look nice.

After running those three commands, you should just have to switch on the SSL/TLS > Origin Server > Authenticated Origin Pulls option in the Cloudflare dashboard and enforce the validation check on your origin server (using the `rootca.crt` file generated by `generate_certs.sh`).
